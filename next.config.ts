/**
 * BUNDLER RECONCILIATION (the same surprise decision-engine and shadow-run
 * already hit and documented — carried over verbatim as shared build
 * tooling, per this project's own house rule that infra is not conceptual
 * code):
 *
 * lib/ is frozen from M1 and every file in it uses relative imports with
 * an explicit ".js" extension pointing at a sibling ".ts" file (e.g.
 * lib/contracts/index.ts imports "./memory.js", which is really
 * memory.ts — the standard TypeScript `moduleResolution: "bundler"` idiom,
 * understood by tsc and by esbuild/Vite, which is why `npm test` (vitest,
 * esbuild-powered) has always resolved it fine).
 *
 * Next.js's bundlers do NOT resolve that pattern the same way:
 *   - Turbopack (Next 16's default, used by plain `next dev` / `next
 *     build`) fails outright — "Module not found" — for every one of
 *     lib/'s internal ".js"-suffixed imports. No Turbopack option in this
 *     Next version (`turbopack.resolveExtensions`, `resolveAlias`) makes
 *     it treat an explicit ".js" specifier as also matching a ".ts" file;
 *     those options only affect extension-less imports.
 *   - webpack resolves it once told to, via the (experimental, but
 *     verified working end-to-end on both sibling projects) `experimental.
 *     extensionAlias` option, mirroring webpack 5's native
 *     `resolve.extensionAlias`.
 *
 * So this project pins the webpack bundler explicitly (`next dev
 * --webpack`, `next build --webpack` in package.json) rather than
 * Turbopack's default, and declares the alias here. The alternative —
 * editing lib/'s import style to drop the ".js" extensions — is rejected
 * because lib/ is frozen after M1: `git diff main -- lib/contracts/` must
 * stay empty from M2 onward.
 *
 * Cost of this choice: the app builds one version behind Next's new
 * default bundler until either Turbopack adds an extension-alias
 * equivalent, or a later milestone recompiles lib/ into real .js output as
 * a build step instead of importing the .ts sources directly.
